## Mini Project Task Digital Skill Fair - Data Science (2 Weeks Mini Course) by Dibimbing.id

## Project Overview
This repository contains an analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on predicting passenger survival using various machine learning models. The primary goal is to compare the performance of different models to determine the most effective one for this dataset.
The Titanic dataset is a well-known dataset used for classification tasks, specifically to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster. In this project, I applied and compared the following machine learning models:
<br>
<br>
Random Forest
<br>
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
<br>
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
<br>
KNeighbors
